# wavpack-rs

Rust bindings for [WavPack](https://www.wavpack.com/). 

The included WavPack version is [5.6.0](https://www.wavpack.com/changelog.txt).

## Current Status 

Reading and writing support is implemented and appears to work correctly,
although is under tested.

Not all APIs are exposed, but please feel encouraged to open PRs for anything 
that you need that's missing.

## Dependencies

* [CMake](https://cmake.org) is used to build WavPack.  
* A C++ compiler.

## Acknowledgments

Many thanks to [Toru3](https://toru3.gitlab.io) who started this project.
